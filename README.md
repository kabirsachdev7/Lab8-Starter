## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation ensures an application maintains core functionality even when some advanced features are unsupported. Service workers enhance this by enabling offline capabilities and improving performance. They cache essential assets and API responses, allowing offline access and reducing load times on slow networks. Service workers also provide fallback responses and handle background synchronization, ensuring a resilient and user-friendly application regardless of network conditions.
